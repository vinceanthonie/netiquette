				<h3>Do be respectful</h3>

				<p>Respectful behavior is essential to effective online communication. It's important to remember that words typed on a screen can still be interpreted as offensive or hurtful, even if they weren't intended that way. To practice good digital manners, try to treat others online the same way you would if you were speaking to them in person. When engaging in online conversations, strive to maintain a courteous and polite tone. Remember to follow netiquette best practices such as being patient and not taking advantage of someone else's lack of knowledge or understanding. Additionally, refrain from name-calling, using inappropriate language, or making hurtful remarks. By taking these steps, you can ensure that your online conversations remain respectful and civil.</p>

				<h3>Do use common sense</h3>

				<p>When communicating online, it is important to use common sense. Digital manners, also known as netiquette best practices, should be applied when sending messages online. Following online communication etiquette will help ensure that your messages are received in a positive and respectful way.</p>
			</li>

				<h3>Don't spam</h3>

				<p>One of the most important rules of online communication etiquette is to never spam others. Spamming involves sending out unsolicited messages or posting irrelevant content on websites, forums, or social media networks. This behavior can be extremely annoying and distracting to other users, and it can also lead to your account being blocked or even deleted. To avoid this, make sure that you are only sending messages to those who have specifically requested them. Additionally, it is important to make sure that all of your posts and messages are relevant to the conversation at hand.</p>
			</li>

				<h3>Don't use all caps</h3>

				<p>Using all caps to type your message can be interpreted as shouting and is considered bad netiquette. It’s an aggressive form of communication, which can come across as rude or hostile. Not only that, but it makes the text hard to read and can be difficult to understand. Instead of using all caps, consider using bold font, italics, or different colors for emphasis. You can also break up your text into smaller paragraphs for easier reading. Remember, when you're communicating online it's best to stay polite and courteous. Using all caps can come across as impolite and unprofessional, so avoid it whenever possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Don't flame</h3>

				<p>Flame wars are one of the most destructive forms of communication in online forums. Flaming occurs when someone insults or provokes another user by posting a malicious, hostile, or inflammatory message. This kind of behavior can quickly spiral out of control and lead to further hostility, trolling, and a generally toxic environment. It's important to remember that everyone has an opinion, and it's okay to disagree with someone else, but this should be done in a respectful manner. If you find yourself feeling angry or frustrated, take a step back and consider if your response is really necessary. When in doubt, it’s always best to ignore a comment rather than reply with a flame. No one likes being insulted, so it’s best to be kind and considerate at all times.</p>

				<h3>Don't hijack threads</h3>

				<p>Hijacking threads, or taking over a conversation, is one of the most egregious violations of netiquette. When someone posts a question or comment on an online forum, it’s important to respect their original topic and refrain from changing the subject. Of course, you can add your opinion or advice if it’s relevant to the conversation, but don’t try to make it all about you or your own experiences. When people hijack conversations, they’re not only being rude, they’re also making it difficult for others to get answers to their questions. If you have something completely unrelated to the thread, start a new one or post your comment elsewhere. Otherwise, you risk derailing the entire discussion and annoying everyone involved.</p>
			</li>

				<h3>Don't forget the human element</h3>

				<p>The most important rule of netiquette is to remember that there are real people behind every comment, post, or tweet. To foster an open and friendly online environment, it's important to treat others with respect, understanding, and empathy. This means refraining from name-calling, aggressive language, and personal attacks. Instead, try to be helpful and provide constructive criticism when possible. Remember to be polite, even if you don't agree with someone else's opinion. Above all, practice common courtesy and good manners when engaging with others online.</p>
